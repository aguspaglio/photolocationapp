# Photo Capture and Location Tracker App

This React Native application allows users to capture photos and save them along with the location where they were taken. The app is built using Expo and TypeScript, with key features including:

- **Photo Capture**: Users can take photos using the device camera.
- **Location Tracking**: The app fetches and displays the location (address) where each photo was taken using `expo-location`.
- **Photo Management**: Photos are saved locally using `AsyncStorage` and can be viewed or deleted.
- **Geocoding**: Locations are converted from coordinates to human-readable addresses.
- **Sharing**: Users can share their photos with others directly from the app.
